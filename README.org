   These are some variable you can tinker with. This list is not
   complete but it's pretty comprehensive.

** Bitnami

**** bitnami-mediawiki-build
     Build a bitnami instance in [[#filesystem_root][FILESYSTEM_ROOT]].

   *WARNING*: XAMPP is built and installed within a jail that is
   fs. It is incompatible with other server stacks. It also does not
